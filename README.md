* device-shadow-api

To build the project in the local working directory after the project has been cloned/forked, run:

```mvn clean install```

from the command line interface.

### Prerequisites

1. The list of tools required to build and run the project:
    JDK 17
    Apache Maven 3.8

Download and Install Apache Maven 3.8 locally and follow the below steps for IntelliJ IDE:
* Go to the right corner of the IDE and get inside the Maven option.
* Select the Maven Settings option and set the Maven Home Path to the path of the Apache Maven 3.8 installed locally.

### Coding style check configuration

[checkstyle.xml](./checkstyle.xml) is the coding standard to follow while writing new/updating existing code.

Checkstyle plugin [maven-checkstyle-plugin:3.2.1](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/) is integrated in [pom.xml](./pom.xml) which runs in the `validate` phase and `check` goal of the maven lifecycle and fails the build if there are any checkstyle errors in the project.

There are a few coding guidelines to be followed manually before requesting for a pull request, the same can be found here:

[Manual coding guidelines](Link to page with coding guidelines)
