## Getting Started

Device Shadow component exposes API that the Device Client can use to resync its configuration, especially when it got disconnected or its configuration is found to be corrupted.

To build the project in the local working directory after the project has been cloned/forked, run:

```mvn clean install```

from the command line interface.

### Prerequisites

The list of tools required to build and run the project:
   - Java 17
   - Maven
   - Container environment

### Installation

[Install Java 17](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&package=jdk#zulu)

[How to set up Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) / [Podman](https://podman.io/)


### Coding style check configuration

[checkstyle.xml](./checkstyle.xml) is the coding standard to follow while writing new/updating existing
code.

Checkstyle plugin [maven-checkstyle-plugin:3.2.1](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/) is
integrated in [pom.xml](./pom.xml) which runs in the `validate` phase and `check` goal of the maven lifecycle and fails
the build if there are any checkstyle errors in the project.

To run checkstyle plugin explicitly, run the following command:
```mvn checkstyle:check```

### Running the tests

To run the tests for this system run the below maven command.

```mvn test```

Or run a specific test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheFirstUnitTest"```

To run a method from within a test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheSecondUnitTest#whenTestCase2_thenPrintTest2_1"```

### Deployment

1. The component can be deployed as Kubernetes pod by installing Device Shadow charts.

Link:
[Charts](../../../ecsp-helm-charts/tree/main/device-shadow)

2. Detailed information about the request and response generated by the [Device Shadow restful services](https://eclipse-ecsp.github.io/ecsp-website/api-def/api-static-swagger.html#tag/device-configuration-controller).
